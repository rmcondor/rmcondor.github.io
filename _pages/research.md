## Working Papers

**Understanding Artisanal Gold Mining: Evidence from Peru**
(with Kai Gehring and Fernando Fernandez)

We collect large-scale primary data on artisanal gold miners in Madre de Dios, a region of the Peruvian Amazon facing severe tensions between livelihoods and environmental conservation. This paper studies how miners' wage expectations vary across formal, informal, and illegal mine types, and how these beliefs affect labor mobility and the potential for a transition toward cleaner mining practices.

**Redefining Time: The Impact of Motherhood on Unpaid Work in Peru**

I study how the transition to motherhood reshapes time use and unpaid labor allocation among Peruvian women, contributing to the literature on structural transformation and gender inequality.

**State Authority, Indigenous Resistance, and Political Change in Peru**
(with Brayan Condori)

Using geospatial data on the Baguazo — a conflict between the Peruvian state and indigenous communities over extractivism vs. conservation — and a differences-in-differences approach, we show that communities exposed to the conflict are significantly more likely to cast protest votes in subsequent local elections.

Hi! I'm Ronny Condor.

I'm a Research Associate at Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA). My main fields of research interests are development economics, public policies, and poverty. I hold my Bachelor degree in Economics at Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos (Lima, Peru). Before joining IPA, I worked as a consultant at the Office of the Comptroller General of Peru in a project in cooperation with the IDB.

I am a Research Associate at the Wyss Academy for Nature at the University of Bern, where I contribute to interdisciplinary research and policy engagement on sustainability and development in the Peruvian Amazon. I hold a Master's in Economics from Universidad de San Andrés (Argentina), where my thesis — awarded the Best Young Researcher Prize at the Argentine Association of Political Economy — studied how Peru's land reform shaped the political participation of indigenous populations.

My research interests lie at the intersection of development economics, political economy, and environmental policy. I combine field experiments, causal inference methods, geospatial analysis, and machine learning to study how land distribution, resource management, and political institutions interact to affect social and economic outcomes — particularly in Latin America.

Before my master's, I spent three years at Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA), leading large-scale data collection for randomized controlled trials across Latin America and the Caribbean. I have also worked as a research assistant at the London School of Economics and Durham University.

I am originally from Peru, and my research is grounded in questions that matter deeply in contexts like the Amazon — where livelihoods, environment, and institutions are in constant tension.

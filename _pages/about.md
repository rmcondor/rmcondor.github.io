I work as a Senior Research Associate at the Wyss Academy for Nature at the University of Bern, where my focus spans interdisciplinary research around sustainability and development in the Peruvian Amazon. I earned my Master's in Economics from Universidad de San Andrés in Argentina, and my thesis — which received the Best Young Researcher Prize from the Argentine Association of Political Economy — explored the effects of Peru's land redistribution reform on the political participation of marginalized communities.

My research interests lie at the intersection of development economics, political economy, and environmental policy with a particular focus in Latin America. I combine field experiments, causal inference methods, geospatial analysis, and machine learning to study how land distribution, resource management, and political institutions interact to affect social, economic and environmental outcomes.

My prior experience includes designd and implementation of randomized controlled trials at Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA). In addition, I have also worked in research positions at the London School of Economics, and Durham University.

I am originally from Peru, and my research is grounded in questions that matter deeply in contexts like the Amazon — where livelihoods, environment, and institutions are in constant tension.

Hi! Welcome to my website!

I'm Ronny Condor. I'm a Master student in Economics at Universidad de San Andr√©s (UdeSA). I also hold my Bachelor degree in Economics at Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos (Lima).  Currently, I am Research Assistant at Durham University, working in a project that tries to understand the motivated reasoning behind forecasts in economic indicators in Argentina. Previously, I have worked as Research Associate at Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA) where I managed field experiments in topics as early childhood development, entrepreneurial mindset and gender gaps in STEM. Before joining IPA, I worked as a consultant at the Office of the Comptroller General of Peru in a project in cooperation with the IDB related to public management control services.

My main fields of research interests are applied economics, development economics, and political economy. I plan to eventually complete a PhD in Economics or another related social science and pursue an academic career.

Hi! Welcome to my website!

I'm Ronny Condor. I'm a Master student in Economics at Universidad de San Andr√©s (UdeSA). I also hold my Bachelor degree in Economics at Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos (Lima). I worked as Research Associate at Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA) where I managed field experiments in topics as early childhood development, entrepreneurial mindset and gender gaps in STEM. Before joining IPA, I worked as a consultant at the Office of the Comptroller General of Peru in a project in cooperation with the IDB related to public management control services.

My main fields of research interests are development economics, inequality, political economy, and poverty.

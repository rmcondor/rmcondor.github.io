Hi! I am Ronny M. Condor, Senior Research Associate at the Wyss Academy for Nature at the University of Bern. I live in the Peruvian Amazon and through interdisciplinary research, I seek solutions to the challenges of sustainability and development in complex regions where livelihoods, environment, and institutions are in constant tension.

I hold a master’s degree in Economics from Universidad de San Andrés, and a bachelor’s degree in Economics from Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos. I am applying to PhD programs in (Applied) Economics for Fall 2026.

My research interests lie at the intersection of development economics, political economy, and environmental policy with a particular focus in Latin America. I combine field experiments, causal inference methods, geospatial analysis, and machine learning to study how land distribution, resource management, and political institutions interact to affect social, economic and environmental outcomes.

My prior experience includes the design and implementation of randomized controlled trials at Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA). In addition, I have worked in research positions at the London School of Economics and Durham University.
